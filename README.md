# Introduction to AI - Oblig 2 (DAVE3625)

1. We picked the first case, to predict stock market price for TESLA
2. We chose a regression algorithm
3. We saw that a supervised machine learning algorithm would be applicable here because we have known input data and we can train the model to predict unknown output data. We chose the linear regression algorithm which we think can fit a stock market price in a sufficient way. It fits the regression algorithm model in the sense that we are mapping date and closing price which have a relationship which shows a constant rate of change.
4. See .ipynb-file
